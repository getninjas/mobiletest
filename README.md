Here is the solution for Offers and Leads made in iOS, using Swift.

I'm using CocoaPods to manage dependencies, and the following libs are being used:

- Alamofire - To call REST Services
- MBProgressHUD - And Objective-C lib writen to manage Loading Dialogs.

I'm also including a design folder with a sketch project used as a prototype guide and the Assets used in the application.
